=== Introduction ===

The E-xact Payment WebService Plug-In is a real-time transaction processing software plug-in, enabling clients to connect to our processing network. Once installed, these tools allow a merchant to capture and authorize credit-card transactions.

This document pertains to the E-xact Payment WebService Plug-In. Transactions are sent by setting required fields, sending the transaction, and reading the data in the response. The WebService uses the SOAP 1.1 protocol. The SOAP message is RPC/Encoded.

The E-xact Payment Plug-In is enabled to take advantage of the 3-D Secure method of cardholder verification (Visa - Verified by Visa; MasterCard - SecureCode). 3-D Secure allows a merchant to verify that the credit card being used belongs to the customer. This process can greatly decrease the merchant's exposure to charge-backs. Provided your merchant accounts are for enabled, you can add 3-D Secure functionality to your processing solution by downloading one of Paymentech's 3-D Secure Plug-Ins.
